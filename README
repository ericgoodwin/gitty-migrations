SmartMigrations
===============

Requires a extended 'rubygit' gem that has stashes
cd vendor/plugins/smart_migrations/extended_rubygit_gem
sudo gem install git-1.0.5

Example
=======

class MyMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
  
	# Would be better if you used a git-tag to tag the revision
  use_git_revision "675bacdd870a098a98aa3f858d92e1047ba28a7d"

  def self.up
    puts "This is a test migration"
  end

  def self.down
    
  end
  
end

TODO
===============

* Check for the revision where the migration was checked in or last edited and 
	automatically use that revision if no revision has been specified
* If there are no stashes then clear the stash when we are done with the migrations
