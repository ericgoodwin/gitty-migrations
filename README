GittyMigrations
===============

Requires a extended 'rubygit' gem that has stashes
cd vendor/plugins/gitty_migrations/extended_rubygit_gem
sudo gem install git-1.0.5

Example
=======

class MyMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
  
	# Will rollback to the commit that this file was checked in on
  use_git
 
	# Will rollback to a certain commit that you define
	# use_git :revision => "2024589c214b41c8b29bcd6444c2d49807760a5a"

  def self.up
    puts "This is a test migration"
  end

  def self.down
    
  end
  
end

TODO
===============

âˆš  Check for the revision where the migration was checked in or last edited and 
	automatically use that revision if no revision has been specified
* If there are no stashes then clear the stash when we are done with the migrations
